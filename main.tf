# SIGNALFX MODULES OF DETECTORS
# This repository contains generic pre-built detectors for SignalFx broken down into multiple terraform modules.
# It aims to speed up alerting deployment and apply infrastructure as code process to monitoring.
# It could also be a place to collect, share and improve alerting rules on popular tools and environments through SignalFx.
# Note that these templates implementation is opinionated and enforce best practices which ensure homogeneity but will 
# also restrict the usage and capabilities even if it tries to provide as much flexibility as possible.
